\subsection*{Bootloader}
A Bootloader is a program that runs when a device is powered on or reset. It is responsible for
loading the operating system kernel to memory and starting its execution. It is usually stored in
the non-volatile memory of the device. Primary purpose: allow a software/firmware to be
updated without the use of specialized hardware (No JTAG programmer).
