\subsection*{Scheduling}
\underline{Timing constraints:}\\
Deadline: D\\
Arrival time: A\\
Release time: R\\
Finish time: F\\
Computation time: C\\

\textit{Task response time} $=f-a$ ou $f-r$\\
\textit{Maximum lateness} $=\max_i(f_i-d_i)$\\
\textit{Maximum number of late tasks}
$=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{miss}(f_i)=
    \begin{cases}
        0 & \text{if } f_i \leq d_i \\
        1 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}$\\
\textit{Schedulability:} $U=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{T_i} \leq 1$\\
Can be increased by increasing task computation times or by decreasing their periods.\\
\textbf{Time cyclic scheduling:}\\
Divide the temporal axis into slots of equal length (length = Minor Cycle).
The optimal length of the Minor Cycle is the GCD (=plus grand diviseur commun) of the periods.
The optimal length of the Major Cycle is the LCM (=plus petit multiple commun) of the periods.
If tasks cannot be split into sub-tasks, then a set of tasks is schedulable if
the sum of execution times within each time slot is less or equal to the Minor
Cycle.\\

Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy to implement
    \item Predictable
    \item No need for a scheduler
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always run the same schedule
    \item The polling rate is limited by 1/maximum delay.
    \item The program must continually check the status of every device
    \item This approach scales badly
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Event-driven systems:}\\
Handling events is done using interrupts. Interrupts can be prioritized.
Interrupts can be masked: switched off if not needed or likely to get in the way of more
important activity. Interrupts can be nested. The location of the ISR in memory can be selected.\\

\textbf{Dynamic scheduling:}\\
Allows task scheduling to be computed dynamically online based on importance or any other
criteria such as task deadline, duration, or creation time.\\
\underline{Task preemption:}\\
Exception handling/interrupt may need to preempt existing tasks.
Suspend a running task and insert it in the ready queue. Schedule tasks based on their
priority/importance. Improve efficiency.\\
Advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Better response time
    \item Can do more processing
    \item Can lower processor speed, saving money and power
\end{itemize}
Disadvantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item More complicated programming
    \item More memory.
    \item Introduces vulnerability
\end{itemize}

\underline{Rate Monotonic Scheduling:}\\
Tasks with higher request rates/shorter periods have higher priorities.
Fixed periods means fixed priorities. Is optimal among fixed-priority algorithms.
\textit{Schedulability:} $U=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{T_i} \leq n(2^{\frac{1}{n}}-1)$\\
\underline{Earliest Deadline First:}\\
Tasks with earlier deadlines have higher priorities.
Priorities are dynamic since absolute deadlines of periodic tasks vary over time.
\textit{Schedulability:} $U=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{C_i}{T_i} \leq 1$\\
